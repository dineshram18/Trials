    "1. Dataset Overview:\n",
    "   - The dataset contains 16,598 entries with 11 columns.\n",
    "   - Columns include Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, and sales data for different regions.\n",
    "   - There are 271 missing values in the Year column and 58 missing values in the Publisher column.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Sales Distribution:\n",
    "   {image_urls_dict['9cc365c9']}\n",
    "   - The distribution of Global Sales is highly skewed, with most games having relatively low sales and a few games with exceptionally high sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Platform and Genre Analysis:\n",
    "   - (Note: Due to an error in the code, we couldn't generate the plots for top platforms and genres by global sales. However, this information would be valuable for understanding which platforms and genres are most successful.)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. K-means Clustering:\n",
    "   {image_urls_dict['82aee588']}\n",

    "   {image_urls_dict['96609eda']}\n",
    "   - The scatter plot shows the distribution of the 4 clusters based on Year and NA_Sales (scaled).\n",

    "   Cluster 0: Recent games with low sales\n",

    "   - Global Sales: 0.45 million\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights and Marketing Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Blockbuster Games (Cluster 1):\n",
    "   - These are the most successful games with very high sales across all regions.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Invest heavily in marketing and development for games with similar characteristics. Focus on creating franchises or sequels to these successful titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moderately Successful Games (Cluster 2):\n",
    "   - These games perform well but not at the blockbuster level.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Analyze what makes these games successful and try to replicate those elements. Consider targeted marketing to boost sales in regions where they perform less well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recent Low-Sales Games (Cluster 0):\n",
    "   - These are newer games that haven't performed well in terms of sales.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Investigate why these games underperformed. Consider adjusting pricing strategies, improving marketing efforts, or focusing on digital distribution channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Older Low-Sales Games (Cluster 3):\n",
    "   - These older games have low sales figures.\n",
    "   - Strategy: For classic titles, consider remastering or re-releasing on newer platforms. For less successful games, analyze what didn't work to avoid similar mistakes in future developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Platform and Genre Focus:\n",
    "   - Analyze which platforms and genres are most represented in the successful clusters.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Prioritize development and marketing efforts for the most successful platforms and genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Regional Sales Patterns:\n",
    "   - Look at the sales distribution across regions for each cluster.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Tailor marketing and localization efforts based on regional performance of similar games.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Outliers and Niche Markets:\n",
    "   - The high number of noise points in DBSCAN suggests many unique or niche games.\n",
    "   - Strategy: For innovative or unique game concepts, consider smaller-scale releases or digital-only distribution to test market reception before larger investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Temporal Trends:\n",
    "   - Analyze how the clusters are distributed across different time periods.\n",
    "   - Strategy: Adapt game development and marketing strategies to align with evolving market trends and consumer preferences over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these insights and tailoring strategies to each cluster, game publishers can optimize their marketing efforts, development focus, and resource allocation to maximize the potential success of their game releases."
